For the powershell script Install_RDS_Web_Broker_Sesion_host 
IMPORTANT It can not be ran on the same machine that you want to install RDS on this is 
due to Microsoft wanting to have it run it via remote powershell

Then for the Powershell sctipt Setting_RDS_GATEWAY It has to be ran on the machine that 
just had the RDS installed on instead of a diffrent box to install it

#####
For right know as of 2/16/2017 The script need the name of the box to be changed from box
to box
